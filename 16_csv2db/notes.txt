- csv.DictReader returns a dictionary
    - we needed to loop through each row in the dictionary to print out the stored data
    - printing out the dictionary without the loop only prints out the location of the dictionary
- looping through each row from the result of the SELECT command allows us to print out the data stored in a table
- a semi-colon is needed at the end of each SQL command; otherwise, the terminal will keep expecting more commands
- Python allows us to assign the values in a list to multiple variables in one line
    - ex: name, age = row.values()
- the execute method has to be used each time we want to run a new SQL command
- instead of concatenating strings and variables, putting f before a string allows us to format it and substitute in variables into it
    - the variables just have to be put between {}
