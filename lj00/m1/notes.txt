Replica Set - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something 
happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate 
- to copy something.

Instance - a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case 
it is the MongoDB database.

Cluster - group of servers that store your data.


Personal/Team Notes:
- use the in browser IDE for the labs
- you don't have to download anything
- the Atlas interface has lots of useful things
- it includes statistics on the database
- you can add and delete users, but we will not really be dealing with that in this course
- you connect to atlas using the connection link you get from clicking the connect button 
on the Atlas interface for the cluster.
